# This file is used by Flutter's tooling to store project-specific metadata.
# It is generated automatically by 'flutter create' and should not be edited manually.

# For a desktop project, it might contain information about enabled platforms.
# Version of Flutter used to create this project.
version:
  revision: "unknown" # As we are creating manually
  channel: "stable"

project_type: app # Indicates a Flutter application

# If desktop platforms were enabled via 'flutter config --enable-<platform>-desktop'
# and then 'flutter create', these might be reflected here or in platform-specific build files.
# For manual setup, this is mostly a placeholder.
# True desktop platform enablement involves more than just this file (e.g., CMake files for Linux/Windows, Xcode project for macOS).
platforms:
  linux: # Indicates linux desktop is intended
  macos: # Indicates macos desktop is intended
  windows: # Indicates windows desktop is intended
  web: # Indicates web is intended
  # android: # Example if android was also intended
  # ios: # Example if ios was also intended
